start


servo1 and servo2 move at same speed same direction
using millis instead of delay
0 to 180 then 180 to 0 continously
to create the illusion of wings flapping
this also (with the help of balloons)will make it move in 
one continous line 


distance sensor serial prints distance in mm 
goes through code with if/or statement that determines if the numbers in mm
are smaller or larger than 20
if they are larger nothing happens
if they are smaller then servo1 stops 
until distance sensor reads a number larger than 20




with one wing (servo motor) flapping and the other wing not 
hopefully this will cause robot to turn until distance sensor no longer reads twenty


when distance sensor no longer reads twenty then servo one resumes the speed it started with
at the beginning (making both wings flap at the same speed again until the distace sensor 
again encounters something close and brings back a reading of twenty or under)
