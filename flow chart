start


servo motors move at similar continous speed 
to create the illusion of wings flapping
this also (with the help of balloons)will make it move in 
one continous line 


distance sensor works from beginning


robot which is moving in a straight line approaches the wall


distance sensor gets reading of number that is under 20
(code will have if/or statement stating that if the distance sensor gets
a reading of twenty or less than servo one motor slows or stops)


with one wing (servo motor) flapping and the other wing not 
hopefully this will cause robot to turn until distance sensor no longer reads twenty


when distance sensor no longer reads twenty then servo one resumes the speed it started with
at the beginning (making both wings flap at the same speed again until the distace sensor 
again encounters something close and brings back a reading of twenty or under)
